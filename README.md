**Stinkbot**
Stinkbot is a bot first created in June 2017 for me and my friends' discord server. He has no useful functionality whatsoever and most
of his commands are specific to me and my friend group. I uploaded him to Github mainly so I could work on him across different devices.
When Stinkbot was first made, he had one long if/else if/else statement in the message event that ran **every**, **single**, **time**. I may
have lost some funny features by moving from that to an actual command handler, but that's a part of growth.

Anyway, if you were looking for a useful bot for your discord server, I would advise you to look elsewhere. If you want to have a looksie at a dumb
bot, you'll have a better time.
